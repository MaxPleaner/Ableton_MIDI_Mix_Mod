# Ableton_MIDI_Mix_Mod

A modified Ableton MIDI Remote Script for the Akai MIDI Mix. 

This was created with Remotify / Control Surface Studio but I'll share it here so you don't have to buy that program.

## Mappings

This preserves most of the default mappings for this controller but gets rid of the Panning / Send mapping on the 3 rows of knobs.

Instead, the first two rows are set up to control device parameters, which will activate automatically on whatever track / device is currently selected. The third row of knobs is unmapped. 

Of course you can always override these mappings in your Ableton project.

Unfortunately, it was too complicated to figure out the Solo row stuff, so the Mute row just does mutes, and the Solo button is ignored.
